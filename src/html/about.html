        <p class="mt2 mb1">Welcome to Bookmark! I’m Tori, a mother of four who is obsessed with children's books. J.K. Rowling said, "If you don't like to read, you haven't found the right book." I believe that's true, and I think there is a book (or two or ten) out there that every child can connect with. I created Bookmark to help kids find those books and bring the joy and ease back into reading.</p>
